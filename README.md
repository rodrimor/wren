# About this project

 Credit card companies have been struggling with their old systems, and complex systems that often cause problems for their customers and those employees who spend hours of their time solving issues in the users accounts. 

 It is noteworthy almost all of us who use a credit card have heard the sentence "Sorry sir, the system has x instability right now". This is what wren comes to solve, instability issues, upgrade those awful interfaces made two decades ago in HTML4. 
 
## Our philosophy 

 Our philosophy consists in to deliver the best experience for users, they do not have to notice wren working users only will use it. When an regular user comes and say something about our inner system, this means the system is not working well. The goal to make an imperceptible system for most of our customer.

 "Not everybody knows how an engine works. People just start it and drive."

## Why the name of the project is Wren?
  The name is a accronism of Web Register Environment, also Wren is a robust tiny bird, and also Wrens are bug eaters.

## Why is the License BSD 3-Clause? 

>    A choice amid a sea of options
  There are several open-source licenses out there. The people who run these projects must choose the "license" carefully. It must be coherent with the goals of the project, its purpose, and its distribution.  

  The BSD 3-clause got chosen for the following reasons

   Specific clauses for binary code distribution:
   Wren is a program written in programming language that generates binary code. So having some guarantees on this plagiarism or even misuse use of the program are priority. 

  The third clause states: 
   3 - "Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission."

   When a new open-source program is released, its hard to track all forks it can have and what the derivades programs are architected to do. With this the Authors of Wren project endorse what we stated in our About and Project Targets.
